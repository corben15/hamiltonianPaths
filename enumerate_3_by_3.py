Problem Definition:
    Find a maximum translation cycle so that when you translate a hamiltonian
    path you get another hamiltonian pathself.

    ex:
    A solution for the 3x3 is below. The cycle size is 20 which is received by
    finding the lowest common multiple of the  of the sides of the arrayself.

    3*3 = 9 ==> 4+5 = 9 ==> 4*5 = 20

        [1,4,5                              [9,2,3
         2,3,6      ==Translates to ==>      8,1,4
         9,8,7]                              7,6,5]
